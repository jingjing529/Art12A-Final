# Art12A-Final
In my ART12A class, we were asked to choose a media platform to strike. 
Art12A-Final is a GUI that reflects what happened when I opened wechat after 48 hours strike and my thoughts.

## Inspiration
At first, I plan to do a comparison of different content of posts' impact to the number of likes and commentsfor my final project. However, CSSA at UCI suddenly notified me that the online freshman meetup which I was in charge of preaching took place during my strike. I had an inspiration on a whim: maybe my final project can do something related to the number of messages I received in 48 hours. After all, after introducing UCI to freshmen, they will definitely send me a lot of private messages and questions. The freshman meetup is a huge success and I was particularly looking forward to the number of DMs, so as soon as the 48-hour time limit arrived, I opened WeChat immediately. At that moment, I was deeply shocked by the number of DMs, so I made what happened at that time into my project.

## Description
As I wrote in my midterm proposal, I plan to use these 48 hours to complete a programming assignment for ics33. So I decide to combine the programming techniques that I just learned in class with this artwork together and present this project in a coding form. The following video reflects the whole process of my feelings after opening WeChat. After clicking log in, I found that there were messages from my family, friends, the UCI freshmen and an HR who just offered me a position of tutoring. Below the profile photos which I used emojis to represent, is an excerpt of the messages they sent to me. But because there was so many messages, and it was 12a.m. here, it was already 3a.m. after replying to all the messages. Since WeChat is an app that most of the users are Chinese and lives in China, itâ€™s their afternoon when I start replying messages, so they will send me follow up questions. So I put my mood changes at the top of my project, from "Wow, I am popular!!" to "Let me go, I want to sleep :(".
Before doing this strike, I thought I can never stop using WeChat since I don't want to loose contact with my family members and my friends. However, I enjoyed this 48 hours. I focused on my schoolwork and invited my friends over to my place to cook together. I thought I will feel satisfied when I saw all those messages, but there's too much pressure to reply everyone's message. I use WeChat much less after the strike since I found out I spent so much time and energy on maintaining the relationships with Chinese and failed to enjoy my own life, life here in America.
